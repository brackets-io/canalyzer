=================

This extension uses a set of 'markers' (regex patterns) to scan your project for things that can possibly cause compatability issues. For example, it will log navigator.geolocation.

It associates each marker with a particular caniuse.com ID.

The dictionary (markers.json) has a grand total of *2* items now so I'm looking for folks to help flesh it out!
